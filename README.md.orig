Configuration Options
---------------------
 
Most configuration options are accessible through the settings editor where the Battlelog profile settings are. Settings are saved and read from `config.ini`.

### General Options
* `manageOrigin` toggles whether Battlelogium will create a new, managed instance of Origin so that Steam is aware of any child processes that Origin starts and therefore will attempt to hook the Steam overlay. Unless you are using a [.par file patch](http://par.nofate.me/) or [Outcome](http://outcome.nofate.me/), this should be set to true. **Battlelogium does not come with included installs for either Outcome or .par file patches since version 2.0**

* `waitTimeToKillOrigin` specifies in seconds how long to wait before a managed instance of Origin is closed, for the purposes of allowing cloud sync. By default this value is 10 seconds to allow Origin to sync to the cloud before closing. **This setting is not available from the settings editor and must be changed manually in the configuration file**

* `checkUpdates` toggles whether to check for updates to Battlelogium. Updates are retrieved from this GitHub repository and can be downloaded and installed. It is recommended that you check for any updates in case of bugfixes.

### Window Settings
* `fullscreenMode` toggles whether Battlelogium will start in a borderless fullscreen window, covering the whole screen, including the taskbar. Window modes are toggle-able with **Alt-Enter**.

* `disableHardwareAccel` disables hardware acceleration on the main Battlelogium window, forcing the window to render in software (CPU) mode. While this disables the Steam overlay being able to render on the Battlelogium window (**Steam overlay will still work in-game**) and thus fixing issues that pop up relating to the Steam overlay's incompatibility with WPF, rendering with the CPU causes a significant drop in smoothness and performance and may effect in-game performance, it is recommended that hardware accelerate be kept on.

* `windowHeight` and `windowWidth` specify the forced height and width of the window respectively. If either is set to 0, Battlelogium will resume your previous window size and position, else, if both a width and height are set, it will always start the window with those dimensions.

* `rightClickDrag` enables the legacy behavior of dragging around the borderless window* by holding down the right mouse button. This is no longer needed, simply drag the top of the window as you would normally using the left mouse button to move the window. However, if some users have gotten used to that behavior they may wish to enable it again.

_*Since Battlelogium 2.0, the option to have a window with a border chrome on it has been removed, therefore, the `noBorder` setting is no longer available. A borderless window is the default, and only windowed mode behavior_

Building
--------
Build using Visual Studio 2013 or [Visual Studio Express 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop). Dependencies are handled by NuGet and do not have to manually installed.

Building `Battlelogium.ThirdParty.SteamShortcutManager` (forked from [scottrice/SteamShortcutManager](https://github.com/scottrice/SteamShortcutManager) required Python 2.7 and PyInstaller to be installed. Run `build.py` to build a windows executable. Visual Studio will not build SteamShortcutManager as part of the solution build process, it must be built manually.
